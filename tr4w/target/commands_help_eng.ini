[ADD DOMESTIC COUNTRY]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Valid country ID. When TR4W is treating some countries as domestic multipliers and the rest of the countries differently, you can add countries to the list of those that are being processed as domestic multipliers. Normally this list is set up by the CONTEST statement, but you can use this command multiple times to add as many countries to the domestic list as you want. You can clear out the default list by using the command ADD DOMESTIC COUNTRY = CLEAR first, and then adding the ones you want. Make sure the country IDs you add match the ones in your CTY.DAT file.

[ALL CW MESSAGES CHAINABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Normally, when you press a function key memory when a CW message is already playing, the previous message will be aborted and the new message started. However, if you set this flag to TRUE, the new message will not start until the old one is complete. You can also do this for selected CW messages by placing a ctrl-D at the start of the message.

[ALLOW AUTO UPDATE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=Allow auto rescore of the log in networked mode after QSO edit.

[ALT-D BUFFER ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This command controls whether the alt-D buffer is enabled. When this flag is enabled, TR4W obtains calls and frequencies from the bandmap when performing a dupecheck on the second radio.

[ALT-D CQ ENABLE]
DEFAULT = FALSE
DESCRIPTION=(SO2R) Setting this to true will enable a CQ to be automatically sent on the run rig upon completion of exchange on S&P rig.

[ALWAYS CALL BLIND CQ]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This function is principally designed to be useful in contests like the Sprint when you are using TR4W with two rigs. In such a situation, you often want to send a CQ on the other rig while you are receiving the exchange from the station to whom you are about to cede the frequency. Normally you do this by pressing F7 or F8, which by default sends CQ on the inactive rig. Setting the ALWAYS CALL BLIND CQ function to TRUE causes that CQ to occur automatically as soon as the CQ EXCHANGE has been sent. (It sends whatever message is stored in Exchange memory F7.). Note that this does force you to be ready for that CQ by finding a clear frequency in time for it to be sent.

[ASK FOR FREQUENCIES]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When using the bandmap or submitting packet spots in an environment in which you do not have a radio that communicates with TR4W, the program will normally ask you for the frequency of stations as you perform dupe checks. Setting this parameter to FALSE will stop TR4W from asking you for these frequencies.

[AUTO CALL TERMINATE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When you are on CW and this parameter is TRUE, TR4W can automatically terminate callsigns that you enter in response to a CQ. When coupled with the START SENDING NOW KEY or the AUTO SEND CHARACTER COUNT commands, TR-LOG will assume that a call is complete when all the characters entered in the Call Window have been transmitted. For example, assume that 4U1ITU has answered your CQ. If you press the key identified by the START SENDING NOW KEY command after entering 4U1I, the program will start to send 4U1I. If you enter one or more additional characters before it completes sending, TR-LOG will send those characters as well. If there are no new characters to send, it will automatically send the CQ EXCHANGE. TR4W works the same way if the AUTO SEND CHARACTER COUNT function causes the program to start sending the callsign. In this case, it is possible to respond to a station by using the same number of keystrokes that are in its callsign.

[AUTO DISPLAY DUPE QSO]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When you are working a duplicate QSO in CQ Mode and this parameter is TRUE, TR4W will automatically show you the log entries for the previous QSO(s) with that station. This command is nonfunctional if you set AUTO DUPE ENABLE CQ to FALSE.

[AUTO DUPE ENABLE CQ]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter is now ignored. It did produce a 'QSO B4' message. Reference GitHub issue 556 for more information. 'QSO B4' message may be added to any F key if desired.

[AUTO DUPE ENABLE S AND P]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=If this parameter is TRUE, when you try to call a dupe with the <Enter> key in S&P Mode, TR4W will refuse to call the station. You might want to set this parameter to FALSE in contests like the Internet Sprint, in which you often call the same station on the same band and mode several times during the contest.

[AUTO QSL INTERVAL]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Normally when you press <Enter> to log a QSO, the QSL MESSAGE is transmitted. The AUTO QSL INTERVAL command can be used to send the QUICK QSL MESSAGE instead, except that once every AUTO QSL INTERVAL QSOs, the QSL MESSAGE is transmitted instead. This is typically used when dealing with a large pileup. If you set AUTO QSL INTERVAL to 3, then the QUICK QSL MESSAGE would be sent, except for every third QSO. A value of zero disables this feature, in which case the QSL MESSAGE is sent at the end of every QSO.

[AUTO QSO NUMBER DECREMENT]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=If you have programmed an S&P exchange that includes a QSO number, you might find yourself in the situation in which you have just logged a station who is now asking for a repeat of the exchange you sent him. If you press F2, you will send the next QSO number, which will be one more than the one you sent the first time. To fix this problem, you can set AUTO QSO NUMBER DECREMENT to TRUE; this causes TR4W to decrement the QSO number when you press F2 when both the Call Window and the Exchange Window are empty.

[AUTO RETURN TO CQ MODE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=If this parameter is TRUE, then pressing <Enter> in S&P Mode when there is no information in either the Call Window or the Exchange Window will cause TR4W to return to CQ Mode.

[AUTO S&P ENABLE SENSITIVITY]
DEFAULT=500
DESCRIPTION=Controls how quickly you must move the VFO (in Hz/sec) in order for the program to jump automatically into S&P Mode if AUTO S&P ENABLE is TRUE.

[AUTO S&P ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, TR4W will automatically jump into S&P Mode if it detects you have moved the VFO quickly. See also AUTO S&P See also AUTO S&P ENABLE SENSITIVITY.

[AUTO SEND CHARACTER COUNT]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=TR4W can start to send the callsign of a station responding to your CQ after you have typed a certain number of characters in the callsign of the calling station. This number of characters is controlled with the AUTO SEND CHARACTER COUNT command. For example, if you set AUTO SEND CHARACTER COUNT to 3 and 4U1ITU calls you, the program will start sending the call after you have typed 4U1. If you enable the AUTO CALL TERMINATE feature, the program will transmit the CQ EXCHANGE message when it has sent all the characters you have typed. When the AUTO SEND CHARACTER COUNT is non-zero, an arrow will appear above the Call Window to indicate the point at which TR4W will begin to transmit the callsign. You can disable this function with the Alt-- command. The arrow will then disappear. To re-enable it, press Alt-- again and the arrow will reappear. You can delete any unsent characters with the backspace key.

[AUTO TIME INCREMENT]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=If you are entering a log by hand, the AUTO TIME INCREMENT feature can be very useful. Setting the value to a non-zero value n will cause the clock to increment by one after every n QSOs. A value of zero disables the feature.

[AUTO-CQ DELAY TIME]
DEFAULT=3000
DESCRIPTION=

[BAND MAP ALL BANDS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If TRUE, the bandmap displays entries from all bands. If FALSE, the bandmap displays entries on the current band only. When the cursor is in the bandmap, the value of this flag may be toggled with the B key.

[BAND MAP ALL MODES]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If TRUE, the bandmap displays entries from all modes. If FALSE, the bandmap displays those entries associated with the current mode only. When the cursor is in the bandmap, the value of this flag may be toggled with the M key.

[BAND MAP CALL WINDOW ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this is TRUE, and you tune to a frequency that has a station in the bandmap, the callsign and exchange information of the station will be displayed in the Call Window. This allows you to renew the entry by simply pressing the space bar1. The exchange information is shown to help you to identify the station quickly. If you start entering a new callsign, the entry in the Call Window will first be erased.

[BAND MAP CUTOFF FREQUENCY]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Allows you to change, on a band-by-band basis, the frequency below which the mode is assumed to be CW and above which it is assumed to be SSB. When you enter a frequency (in Hz), TR4W will automatically deduce the band for which you are defining a new cutoff frequency. To define new cutoff frequencies for multiple bands, simply include the command as many times as necessary in your *.CFG file, once per cutoff frequency.

[BAND MAP DECAY TIME]
DEFAULT=60
DESCRIPTION=This controls the number of minutes for which a new entry will remain visible on the bandmap. The value can be any positive integer less than 32,768. 1Renewing a station with QSX information in this manner will remove the QSX information.

[BAND MAP DISPLAY CQ]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When FALSE, CQ entries will not appear in the band map.

[BAND MAP DISPLAY LIMIT]
DEFAULT=164
DESCRIPTION=This parameter allows you to limit the number of spots the bandmap will display. Above the limit the displayed spots will be centred on the operating frequency. The value must be an even number between 30 and 1000.

[BAND MAP DUPE DISPLAY]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=Controls whether the bandmap will include frequencies on which you have called CQ.

[BAND MAP ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Determines whether the bandmap is displayed. See section 6.13 for more information. If you start TR4W with the bandmap disabled, you will have to restart the program for it to be in the correct video mode to display the bandmap.

[BAND MAP GUARD BAND]
DEFAULT=200
DESCRIPTION=Values: Integer (Hz). The bandmap will indicate if a displayed entry is near the frequency of your interfaced radio by causing the appropriate entry to highlight.
[BAND MAP MULTS ONLY]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=

[BAND MAP SPLIT MODE]
DEFAULT=BY CUTOFF FREQ
DESCRIPTION=This parameter allows you to handle properly the mode of stations that are on the bandmap and are operating split. The default value allows you to tailor the CW and PHONE ranges with the BAND MAP CUTOFF FREQUENCY command.

[BAND]
DEFAULT=160
DESCRIPTION=You can select the band on which TR4W will start if no contacts have yet been made. After the program is running, use alt-B or alt-V to change band. Some contests are single-band contests and may not let you change bands after a QSO has been made.

[BANDMAP ITEM HEIGHT]
DEFAULT=17
DESCRIPTION=Height of item in band map window.

[BANDMAP ITEM WIDTH]
DEFAULT=139
DESCRIPTION=Width of item in band map window.

[BEEP ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When set to FALSE, all beeps generated on the PC speaker by TR4W are disabled.

[BEEP EVERY 10 QSOS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When set to TRUE, a short beep will be generated every tenth QSO. This is useful when entering a log by hand after the contest to make sure that you havent skipped any contacts.

[BOLD FONT]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=Set bold font in program windows.

[BROADCAST ALL PACKET DATA]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is set to TRUE and you are using a multi network, all data coming from the TNC are sent to all the computers in the network, where the packet information is viewable with the ctrl-B command. Commands may also be sent from any computer on the network to the TNC. Beware that data are not sent to the TNC until <Enter> is pressed.

[CALL WINDOW SHOW ALL SPOTS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When TRUE, as you tune in S&P Mode, all calls that TR4W knows about will appear in the Call Window even if they do not appear in the bandmap. For example, if you have BAND MAP DUPE DISPLAY set to FALSE, dupes will not appear in the bandmap, but they still appear in the Call Window if CALL WINDOW SHOW ALL SPOTS is TRUE.

[CALLSIGN UPDATE ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is set to TRUE, TR4W will parse the Exchange Window looking for callsigns; if it finds one, the program will act exactly as if the call had been changed in the Call Window. You must type in the complete call, and spaces must both precede and follow it. If this parameter is TRUE, ctrl-U will send the call in the Exchange Window (otherwise it sends the call in the Call Window).

[CATEGORY-ASSISTED]
DEFAULT=NON-ASSISTED
DESCRIPTION=Used to generate Cabrillo file and for posting score to on-line score systems.

[CATEGORY-BAND]
DEFAULT=ALL
DESCRIPTION=Used to generate Cabrillo file and for posting score to on-line score systems.

[CATEGORY-MODE]
DEFAULT=CW
DESCRIPTION=Used to generate Cabrillo file and for posting score to on-line score systems.

[CATEGORY-OPERATOR]
DEFAULT=SINGLE-OP
DESCRIPTION=Used to generate Cabrillo file and for posting score to on-line score systems.

[CATEGORY-POWER]
DEFAULT=HIGH
DESCRIPTION=Used to generate Cabrillo file and for posting score to on-line score systems.

[CATEGORY-TRANSMITTER]
DEFAULT=ONE
DESCRIPTION=Used to generate Cabrillo file and for posting score to on-line score systems.

[CHECK LOG FILE SIZE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When TRUE, TR4W will check the size of the log *.trw file to ensure it is the proper size for the number of contacts. This feature can alert you to a disk failure and prevent you from losing too much data. If this error occurs, you should stop the program, back up the files you have to a floppy, run a disk utility to see if you can recover any lost data, and then reboot your computer.

[CLEAR DUPE SHEET]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Program will clear the dupesheet when this parameter is set to TRUE in a *.CFG file that is executed with the ctrl-V command. TR4W does nothing if the command is found in the *.CFG file during the start-up process.

[CODE SPEED]
DEFAULT=35
DESCRIPTION=Use this command to set the CW speed at which TR4W will start. While the program is running, you can use the alt-S command to set a new speed or use the Page-Up/Page-Down keys to change the code speed in increments of CW SPEED INCREMENT, which is 3 WPM by default. The changes instantly affect any CW being sent.

[COLUMN DUPESHEET ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter controls the format of the visible dupesheet when it is displayed in VGA mode below the normal operating screen. When TRUE, TR4W will place each of the ten numerical call districts in its own column. This makes it easier to find a specific call quickly. If two columns each contain more than 25 calls, the display of the dupesheet reverts to its normal mode.

[COMPLETE CALLSIGN MASK]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=A string defines a mask call, which will be inserted into the input box when you hit function key programmed with the command <03>COMPLETECALL<04>.

[COMPUTER ID]
DEFAULT=
DESCRIPTION=Values: A to Z, or none. When the COMPUTER ID is set to a letter, that letter will be printed just after the QSO number in the log sheet. There is a command in POST that can be used to separate the logs by COMPUTER ID, which can be useful in multi-multi environments.

[COMPUTER NAME]
DEFAULT=New
DESCRIPTION=The name of the computer in the TR4W network. The name will be displayed in the window "Network".

[CONFIRM EDIT CHANGES]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter determines whether you are asked if you want to save the changes made after editing one of your five most recent QSOs (i.e., the QSOs in the editable log) using the alt-E command. Normally, TR4W will ask you whether you want to save changes before updating the LOG.TMP file. To stop TR4W from asking this question, set this parameter to FALSE.

[CONNECTION AT STARTUP]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If the value is TRUE and if "DX-Cluster" window is opened the program will try to connect to telnet cluster at startup.

[CONNECTION COMMAND]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Command determines the string that will be sent to telnet DX-cluster at connection.

[CONTACTS PER PAGE]
DEFAULT=50
DESCRIPTION=This controls the number of contacts printed on each page of the log.

[CONTEST NAME]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter specifies the name of the contest. TR4W adds your call and the year to generate the CONTEST TITLE.

[CONTEST TITLE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=The CONTEST TITLE is displayed at the top of the screen and in the header of the log pages.

[CONTEST]
DEFAULT=DUMMY CONTEST
DESCRIPTION=The CONTEST statement tells TR4W which contest you are going to operate.

[COUNT DOMESTIC COUNTRIES]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Setting this parameter to TRUE causes TR4W to include domestic QSOs in the count of DX countries. (This is in addition to any domestic multiplier that the QSO might accrue.)

[COUNTRY INFORMATION FILE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This command allows you to specify a file that has up to five lines of text associated with a country (countries are defined by the CTY.DAT file). The text will be displayed in the editable log window when you work the station. The file format consists of the country ID character (as used in the CTY.DAT file) on the first line, followed by up to five lines of text. A blank line indicates the end of the data and can be followed by the next country ID. There is no limit to the file size or to the number of countries.

[CUSTOM CARET]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=If the value is TRUE in the callsign and exchange windows of the main window will be created rectangular carriage.

[CUSTOM INITIAL EXCHANGE STRING]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This string defines how your initial exchange will be constructed if you set INITIAL EXCHANGE to the value CUSTOM. You may select any number of the following fields, and put them in any order: CHECK, CQZONE, FOC, GRID, ITUZONE, NAME, OLDCALL, QTH, SECTION, TENTEN, USER1, USER2, USER3, USER4 and USER5.

[CUSTOM USER STRING]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This string defines how your user info will be shown if you set USER INFO SHOWN to the value CUSTOM. You may select any number of the following fields, and put them in any order: CHECK, CQZONE, FOC, GRID, ITUZONE, NAME, OLDCALL, QTH, SECTION, TENTEN, USER1, USER2, USER3, USER4 and USER5.

[CW ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is FALSE, the computer is prevented from sending any CW, except CW sent from the paddle.

[CW SPEED FROM DATABASE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is true, TR4W will look in the TRMASTER database for a CW Speed entry for the callsign you are working. If it finds one, it will send the CQ EXCHANGE at that speed. The CW speed will return to the previous value when sending the QSL MESSAGE or a new CQ (if the QSO is aborted).

[CW SPEED INCREMENT]
DEFAULT=3
DESCRIPTION=

[CW TONE]
DEFAULT=700
DESCRIPTION=The computer can send the CW over its speaker for the purpose of monitoring the transmission. This command allows you to select the pitch of that CW. Setting the value to zero disables sending the CW to the speaker (but the rig will still be keyed). The PADDLE MONITOR TONE command separately controls the tone frequency of CW sent with the paddle.

[DE ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This determines whether DE is sent before your callsign when using the F1 key in S&P Mode. If you dont want the program to put DE in front of your call (which is the case for most operators), set this flag to FALSE.

[DEBUG LOG LEVEL]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Normally set to NONE. Support may request the following options: NONE, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE. Check TR4W directory for file named tr4w.log


[DIGITAL MODE ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, you can select DIG as a mode when using the alt-M command. DIG is treated as a distinct mode, separate from CW and SSB. This feature is intended to allow you to log digital QSOs made during the ARRL Field Day.

[DISPLAY REFRESH]
DEFAULT=1
DESCRIPTION=Number of spots buffered in range of (1-10) before a screen refresh occurs. This reduces screen blinking but also reduces accuracy of spots as the spots buffer and screen display can get out of sync. When buffering spots, it is important to select spots as close to time of screen refresh as possible.

[DISTANCE MODE]
DEFAULT=KM
DESCRIPTION=This parameter controls the display of the distance to the station you are working. The distance is shown along with the beam headings. The value of the distance depends on the value of RADIUS OF EARTH.

[DIT DAH RATIO]
DEFAULT=3
DESCRIPTION=Ratio dit/dah in CW.

[DOMESTIC FILENAME]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This command allows you to specify the name of the domestic multiplier file that will be used by the program. This is normally determined by TR4W automatically when you specify a certain contest with the CONTEST parameter. However, if you are creating your own domestic multiplier file and want the program to use yours instead, you can use this command. Make sure you also set the DOMESTIC MULTIPLIER parameter to the value DOMESTIC FILE, so that TR4W will know to look for a file.

[DOMESTIC MULTIPLIER]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter defines which type of domestic multiplier the program will use.

[DUPE CHECK SOUND]
DEFAULT=DUPE BEEP
DESCRIPTION=When performing a dupe check with the space bar, TR4W will normally generate a beep if the station is a dupe. However, you can change the program to be silent, or to use the fanfare sound instead.

[DUPE SHEET AUTO RESET]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When TRUE the program will automatically reset dupe sheet after each tour in multi-tours contests.

[DVK ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This command determines whether the DVK is enabled.

[DVK PATH]
DEFAULT=DVK
DESCRIPTION=

[DVK RECORDER]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=

[DX MULTIPLIER]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This command determines which type of DX multiplier the program will use.

[ESCAPE EXITS SEARCH AND POUNCE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, pressing <Esc> when in S&P Mode causes TR4W to revert to CQ Mode. When the parameter is FALSE, the only way to revert to CQ Mode is to press shift-Tab. However, the FALSE setting is ignored if you have a call ready for a QSO on the other rig. This allows you to abort a second-radio QSO with <Esc> even if this parameter is FALSE.

[EXCHANGE MEMORY ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter allows you to control whether the TR4W exchange memory is used. The exchange memory is useful when working the same station on different bands or modes, and when the exchange contains either a class (e.g., ARRL Field Day), power (ARRL DX), age (All Asian), name, ITU Society name (IARU), zone, or Domestic QTH. If you have worked the station before in the contest, the constant information will appear without you having to re-enter it. Please note that this information is lost if you stop TR4W and the *.RST file is deleted.

[EXCHANGE RECEIVED]
DEFAULT=UNKNOWN
DESCRIPTION=This parameter tells TR4W what kind of exchange data to expect. It is normally controlled by the CONTEST statement in the.*.CFG file.

[FARNSWORTH ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When slowing down the CW speed, it is often desirable to increase the space between letters. Turning on FARNSWORTH ENABLE will increase the spaces between letters exponentially as your speed decreases below the value of FARNSWORTH SPEED (default is 25 WPM). You can control this parameter dynamically while sending a CW message.

[FARNSWORTH SPEED]
DEFAULT=25
DESCRIPTION=Values: Integer (WPM). Controls the CW speed at which the Farnsworth effect starts. As you decrease the code speed below this value, there will be exponentially more space added between characters. For increased Farnsworth effect at very slow speeds, increase the value of FARNSWORTH SPEED. You can also control this parameter dynamically within CW messages.

[FLOPPY FILE SAVE FREQUENCY]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Values: Integer (# of contacts). This command allows you to control how frequently TR4W saves the current log to another file. A value of 0 (which is the default) disables this feature.

[FLOPPY FILE SAVE NAME]
DEFAULT=C:\LOGBACK.TRW
DESCRIPTION=This command allows you to backup the *.TRW file periodically throughout the contest to another disk drive. To enable this fetaure, set the FLOPPY FILE SAVE FREQUENCY equal to the number of contacts you wish to make between backups. The name of the file to which the backup will be made is controlled by the FLOPPY FILE SAVE NAME command. The names of these commands are misleading: you can make backups to any drive; you can even make backups to the current working directory as long as the name of the backup file is something different from *.TRW.

[FOOT SWITCH MODE]
DEFAULT=DISABLED
DESCRIPTION=This command determines what happens when you press a foot switch that is connected to pin 15 of the port specified by the FOOT SWITCH PORT command.

[FOOT SWITCH PORT]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=

[FREQUENCY ADDER RADIO ONE]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=

[FREQUENCY ADDER RADIO TWO]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=

[FREQUENCY MEMORY ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When set to TRUE, this parameter will enable the frequency memory. This means that you will return to the frequency you were last using when returning to a band (even with the other radio).

[FREQUENCY MEMORY]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Frequency (kHz). When TR4W first switches to a band/mode, it has a frequency that it will go to as a default. Use this command if you would like to change the default value. Use this command once per band that you would like to change. If you are specifying a frequency that might be processed as a CW frequency but which you want to be used as an SSB frequency, put SSB in front of it (e.g.:FREQUENCY MEMORY = SSB 7050). Note that these defaults will be updated with actual frequencies used for later band/mode changes if you set FREQUENCY MEMORY ENABLE to TRUE.

[FREQUENCY POLL RATE]
DEFAULT=10
DESCRIPTION=Values: Integer 10 to 1000 (msec). This command tells TR4W how frequently to poll the rig for a new frequency. The value is in milliseconds, and the allowed values are in the range 10 to 1000.

[GRID MAP CENTER]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Four- or six-character grid reference. This parameter will set the centre of a grid map that will show you at a glance the grids you have worked. The grid map will be displayed in VGA mode (if available). The ctrl-Left and ctrl-Right keys may be used to move the grid map sideways. (There is no way to move the grid map vertically.)

[HAND LOG MODE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=

[HF BAND ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter enables the HF bands below 30 MHz. It is automatically set to FALSE when you select a VHF contest.

[HOUR DISPLAY]
DEFAULT=THIS HOUR
DESCRIPTION=Values: THIS HOUR, LAST SIXTY MINUTES or BAND CHANGES. This parameter determines how the hour rate display works. In the THIS HOUR mode, it shows the number of QSOs made during the current hour (starting at 15:00, for example). In the LAST SIXTY MINUTES, it shows the number of contacts made during the last 60 minutes. The BAND CHANGES mode will count how many band changes have been made since the current hour began.

[IE SWITCH]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If TRUE, only spots matched to active InitialExhange and TRMaster File will display to BandMap.

[IN BAND LOCKOUT]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=values:True/False. Default of TRUE prevents Band Map selection that would place both radios on a single band.


[INCLUDE F-KEY NUMBER]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=

[INCREMENT TIME ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Determines whether the "increment time function" using Alt-1 to Alt-0 is enabled. If this flag is set to TRUE, the alt-1 to alt-0 keys will increment the time by 1 to 10 minutes respectively. This function can be useful when entering a log by hand after the contest.

[INITIAL EXCHANGE CURSOR POS]
DEFAULT=AT END
DESCRIPTION=Values: AT START or AT END. When an initial exchange is inserted into the Exchange Window, this command controls whether the cursor is placed at the start or at the end of the exchange.

[INITIAL EXCHANGE FILENAME]
DEFAULT=INITIAL.EX
DESCRIPTION=This parameter allows you to specify the name of the initial exchange file. This file is used by TR4W to determine initial exchanges for the callsigns included in the file. The calls will also be used in the partial call list. The format for the file is: callsign, followed by a space, and then the initial exchange information as you want it to appear in the Exchange Window.

[INITIAL EXCHANGE OVERWRITE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If this parameter is TRUE, then pressing any key after an initial exchange has been entered into the Exchange Window by TR4W will cause the exchange to be erased, allowing you to insert a complete exchange manually.

[INITIAL EXCHANGE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter controls the generation of an initial exchange based upon the callsign. All information except the zone must come from the TRMASTER.DTA database. The zone may come from the database, or if not found there, will be calculated based upon the callsign and the information found in the CTY.DAT country file. If this parameter is set to CUSTOM, your initial exchange will be built using the CUSTOM INITIAL EXCHANGE STRING parameter. This allows you to choose multiple data fields and place them in any order. You can program initial exchanges using the file specified by the INITIAL EXCHANGE FILENAME parameter. Initial exchanges can also come from the initial exchange memory if you have already worked the station once in the contest.

[INSERT MODE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This command allows you to define the initial state of the insert mode, which controls whether characters are overwritten or inserted when editing a callsign or exchange. You can toggle the insert mode while TR4W is running with ctrl-V or the INSERT key.

[INTERCOM FILE ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, all messages sent between computers during the contest will be logged to the file INTERCOM.TXT.

[KEYER RADIO ONE OUTPUT PORT]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=These commands select which computer port is used for the CW and PTT outputs. You may specify serial ports in the range 1 to 4, and parallel ports in the range 1 to 3. When specifying a serial port for CPU keying, you can add the word INVERT to the port name (e.g., SERIAL 1 INVERT). This will invert the CW and PTT signals. This simplifies the interface to a radio which uses inverted signalling. Replace the NPN transistors shown in Appendix B with PNP transistors. Use clamp diodes to prevent the base from going positive.

[KEYER RADIO TWO OUTPUT PORT]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=These commands select which computer port is used for the CW and PTT outputs. You may specify serial ports in the range 1 to 4, and parallel ports in the range 1 to 3. When specifying a serial port for CPU keying, you can add the word INVERT to the port name (e.g., SERIAL 1 INVERT). This will invert the CW and PTT signals. This simplifies the interface to a radio which uses inverted signalling. Replace the NPN transistors shown in Appendix B with PNP transistors. Use clamp diodes to prevent the base from going positive.

[KEYPAD CW MEMORIES]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, the keys 0 to 9 on the keypad will send CQ MEMORIES ctrl-F1 to ctrl-F10 respectively.

[LEADING ZERO CHARACTER]
DEFAULT=T
DESCRIPTION=This parameter allows you to customize the character used as a leading zero when generating serial numbers and LEADING ZEROS has a value greater than zero. Normally, the character is T. However, you might prefer the number 0 or the letter O. If you use the ctrl-J menu to access this parameter, it will let you cycle among those three characters.

[LEADING ZEROS]
DEFAULT=3
DESCRIPTION=If you want your serial number to be a certain length by adding leading zeros, you can specify the length with this command. A value of zero disables the addition of any leading zeros. You can set the character used for leading zeros with the LEADING ZERO CHARACTER command.

[LEAVE CURSOR IN CALL WINDOW]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, the cursor will remain in the Call Window instead of moving automatically to the Exchange Window during the QSO process. Some people prefer this mode in contests where a zone is displayed as the initial exchange and you rarely need to change it.

[LITERAL DOMESTIC QTH]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Normally, TR4W will filter the domestic QTH that you type, and log the QTH as shown in the domestic file. If you would rather log exactly what you type, set this parameter to TRUE.

[LOG FREQUENCY ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, the serial number will be replaced with the frequency of the QSO (without the leading Megahertz part of the value). The band and mode will still be written at the start of the log entry. This feature is only useful if you have an interfaced radio.

[LOG RS SENT]
DEFAULT=59
DESCRIPTION=The outbound signal report that appears in your log can be changed from the default of 59 or 599. Note that the [ character in your CW exchange allows you to enter the strength of the RST transmitted, and this value will be placed in your log instead of the default.

[LOG RST SENT]
DEFAULT=599
DESCRIPTION=The outbound signal report that appears in your log can be changed from the default of 59 or 599. Note that the [ character in your CW exchange allows you to enter the strength of the RST transmitted, and this value will be placed in your log instead of the default.

[LOOK FOR RST SENT]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, a transmitted RST may be entered into the Exchange Window by preceding it with S. For example, typing S57 would place 57 into the log as the transmitted exchange for this QSO.

[LPT1 BASE ADDRESS]
DEFAULT=888
DESCRIPTION=The base address of parallel port LPT1 (PARALLEL 1).

[LPT2 BASE ADDRESS]

This parameter sets the minimum number of bands on which the country must have been worked in order to appear on this report.

[MULTI INFO MESSAGE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=If you are using a computer network for a multi operation, this command will determine whether all QSOs are passed around the network, or only those that are new multipliers.

[MULTI MULTS ONLY]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If you are using a computer network for a multi operation, this command will determine whether all QSOs are passed around the network, or only those that are new multipliers.

[MULTIPLE BANDS]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=These commands control the ability to change bands or modes while working the contest. If you are working a single mode or single band contest, it is recommended that the corresponding flag be set to FALSE. This will prevent you from changing band or mode accidentally during the contest. Before you make your first QSO, you will be able to set the band and mode regardless of the value of these parameters.

[MULTIPLE MODES]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=These commands control the ability to change bands or modes while working the contest. If you are working a single mode or single band contest, it is recommended that the corresponding flag be set to FALSE.

DESCRIPTION=Values: Any string. This command is mandatory when operating the Sweepstakes contest. If CONTEST is set to SWEEPSTAKES, TR4W will prompt you for this value if it is not already set.

[MY CONTINENT]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: AF, AS, EU, NA, OC or SA. Normally, your continent is determined by your callsign. However, if you want the program to place you in a different continent, use this command. It is best to put this command before the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file so that TR4W can configure the contest correctly. The ctrl-J menu allows you to view the value of MY CONTINENT, but not to dit it.

[MY COUNTRY]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any valid country ID. Normally, your country is determined by your callsign. However, if you want the program to place you in a different country, use this command. It is best to put this command before the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file so that TR4W can configure the contest correctly. The ctrl-J menu allows you to view the value of MY COUNTRY, but not to edit it.

[MY FD CLASS]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any valid ARRL Field Day class. This is used to set your station class for ARRL Field Day (e.g., 1A). If you are operating the Field Day, TR4W will prompt you for this value if it is not already set

[MY GRID]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Four- or six-character grid identifier. This parameter identifies the grid from which you are operating. This is used to generate beam heading from your location. It is also used to determine QSO points when using a QSO point method that computes points based upon distance. Use GRID MAP CENTER to set separately the center of the grid map.

[MY IOTA]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: IOTA designator. This is used to set the IOTA identifier of the island from which you are operating (e.g., EU-006).

[MY NAME]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any string. Use this command before the CONTEST statement if you are operating a contest that uses your name as part of the exchange. In contests where the exchange includes the name received in the prior QSO (using the special CW character (), TR4W will use this value as the name that is sent in the first QSO.

[MY POSTAL CODE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any string. Used in the RSGB ROPOCO (Rotating Post Code) contest as the postcode sent in the first QSO.

[MY PREC]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: A, B, M, Q, S or U. This command is mandatory when operating Sweepstakes. If you are operating Sweepstakes, TR4W will prompt you for this value if it is not already set.

[MY QTH]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any string. This is a synonym for MY STATE.

[MY SECTION]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any string. This is mandatory when operating Sweepstakes or ARRL Field Day. If your chosen contest requires this information, TR4W will prompt you for this value if it is not already set.

[MY STATE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any string. In some of the contests where a state or province is part of the exchange, TR4W will automatically configure the CW messages to include your location. This command allows you to tell the program what state (or province) to use in these messages. This command is also used to determine your state for various state QSO parties. Use the ordinary United States Postal Service two-letter state abbreviation to set your state. It is best to put this command before the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file so that the information is processed correctly.

[MY ZONE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Integer Normally, your zone is determined by your callsign. However, if you want TR4W to place you in a different zone, use this command. It is best to put this command before the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file, so that TR4W will configure the contest properly. However, the relationship between what happens when the contest executes the MY ZONE command and when it executes the CONTEST command is complex, and under some circumstances (for example, the IARU contest) the MY ZONE command should appear after the CONTEST command. The most common symptom of having these commands in the incorrect order is that TR4W will score the contest as if you were in a different zone from the one in which you are actually located. If you see that TR4W does not seem to be scoring the contest properly, you should try switching

[NAME FLAG ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, an asterisk is shown in the log when you make a QSO with a station whose name is known.

[NET STATUS UPDATE INTERVAL]

[PARTIAL CALL ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This command allows you to control the partial call function. This is a separate feature from the super check partial (which uses the TRMASTER.DTA database). The callsigns used by the partial call function come from the dupesheet and initial exchange file. When this function is enabled, partial calls will be shown on the bottom of the screen after the second character of a call has been typed into the Call Window. A partial call is defined to be any call that starts with the same letters as those in the Call Window. The WILDCARD PARTIALS parameter determines whether the partial call must appear at the start of

[POLL RADIO ONE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=

[POLL RADIO TWO]

DESCRIPTION=Values: Any character.

[POSSIBLE CALL MODE]
DEFAULT=NAMES
DESCRIPTION=Values: NAMES or ALL. The possible calls that come from the TRMASTER.DTA file can either come from all of the calls or only those with names associated with them. When set to NAMES, the operation is identical to older versions of TR4W which used the name database for possible calls.

[POSSIBLE CALL RIGHT KEY]
DEFAULT=.
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any character. When you are using the PARTIAL CALL ENABLE or the POSSIBLE CALLS feature, you are shown a list of calls in the bottom of the operating screen. The first call shown will have a cursor around it (like this: <G4AMJ>). You can transfer the callsign with the cursor around it to the Call Window with the POSSIBLE CALL ACCEPT KEY. You can move the cursor to the left and the right with the POSSIBLE CALL LEFT KEY and the POSSIBLE CALL RIGHT KEY.

[POSSIBLE CALLS]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, the possible call feature is enabled. This causes TR4W to display similar calls from the TRMASTER.DTA database and from your dupesheet when you are working a new station.

[PREFIX MULTIPLIER]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: NONE or PREFIX. This command instructs TR4W how to handle the prefix multiplier. It is normally set by the CONTEST statement in the file *.CFG.

[QSL MODE]
DEFAULT=STANDARD
DESCRIPTION=Values: STANDARD, QSL AND LOG, or QSL BUT NO LOG. This command can be used to change the criteria used to QSL an exchange and to log it when you are in CQ Mode. Normally, TR4W requires the complete exchange to be entered before you can QSL and log the contact. However, if you select QSL BUT NO LOG, the QSL message will be sent even if the exchange information is not completed, but you need to finish entering the exchange and hit <Enter> again before it will be logged. QSL AND LOG will totally eliminate any syntax checking on the exchange and log whatever you have entered. This mode is NOT recommended in normal operations.

[QSO BY BAND]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=These parameters determine whether QSOs can be counted again if they occur on different bands or modes. The parameters are set up automatically when the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file is executed, and normally do not require any changes.

[QSO BY MODE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=These parameters determine whether QSOs can be counted again if they occur on different bands or modes. The parameters are set up automatically when the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file is executed, and normally do not require any changes.

[QSO NUMBER BY BAND]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When set to TRUE, the QSO numbers that are displayed on the screen, those that are sent in a CW message with the # character, and those shown in the log will be calculated from the total number of contacts on the active band. This is useful in a multi-transmitter situation where QSO numbers are being sent (e.g., the CQ WPX contest).

DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter determines whether QSX information is decoded from packet spots. You might want to disable this feature if you are a DX station and are not interested in split spots.

[QTC ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This is normally turned on automatically when a WAE is being configured. When you have enabled QTCs, you will need to remember that ctrl-Q is the magic key to send (if you are not in EU) or receive (if you are in EU) QTCs. TR4W will automatically ensure that you do not send a QTC containing the call of the station to whom you are sending the QTC. On CW, both the ctrl-Enter and alt-K keys work as usual even when QTCs are being sent.

[QTC EXTRA SPACE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, extra spaces are inserted between the elements of a QTC.

DESCRIPTION=

[SCORE READING URL]
DEFAULT=http://cqcontest.ru
DESCRIPTION=

[SCP COUNTRY STRING]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: Comma-separated list of country prefixes. This command allows you to limit the stations that are displayed by the Super Check Partial function. Entering a comma-separated list of country prefixes (e.g., K, VE, KL7, KH6, KP2, KP4) causes only stations from those countries to be displayed when performing the Super Check Partial function. The default is to list stations from all countries. If you place a ! or - in front of the list of countries, then only stations in countries not in the list will be displayed by Super Check Partial.

[SCP MINIMUM LETTERS]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Values: 0, 3, 4, or 5. When this parameter is non-zero, it enables the automatic Super Check Partial function. When you enter the number of characters specified, partial calls will be automatically displayed. You must have a TRMASTER.DTA file available for the program for this feature to work.

[SEND COMPLETE FOUR LETTER CALL]

DESCRIPTION=If TRUE typed callsign in callsign window will displayed in "Network" window.

[SINGLE BAND SCORE]
DEFAULT=All
DESCRIPTION=This command can be used to force the score calculator to use the QSOs for only a single band. If you change the value of the SINGLE BAND SCORE parameter during a contest, you will need to delete your *.RST file before restarting TR4W.

[SINGLE RADIO MODE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, TR4W will not switch rigs when you use the alt-R command.

[SKIP ACTIVE BAND]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If you are using two rigs and SKIP ACTIVE BAND is TRUE, TR4W will skip over the band to which the other rig is tuned when switching bands using the alt-B or alt-V commands.

[SLASH MARK CHAR]
DEFAULT=/
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any character. If you wish to use a different keyboard character to make the / mark, use this command to specify it. This is handy for some European keyboards.

[SPACE BAR DUPE CHECK ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=Normally when you press <Space> when a callsign is present in the Call Window, TR4W will perform a dupe check on the displayed callsign. If you press <Space> without a callsign in the window, you will be put into S&P Mode and your callsign will be sent. If you set SPACE BAR DUPE CHECK ENABLE to FALSE, you will always go into S&P Mode and send your call, even if a call is present in the Call Window.

[SPRINT QSY RULE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If this parameter is TRUE, TR4W will automatically enter CQ Mode after completing a QSO in S&P Mode. This parameter is automatically set to TRUE when the Sprint contest is selected. See subsection 6.18.1 for more information on operating the Sprint. You should not set this variable to TRUE unless you are operating the Sprint. For similar (but not quite identical) behaviour in other contests, see the AUTO S&P ENABLE command.

[START SENDING NOW KEY]
DEFAULT=«'» (the open-single-quote key, not the apostrophe)
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any key. If you are running stations on CW and a station that has answered you has already finished sending his call, but you have not yet finished typing his call, you can press the START SENDING NOW KEY. This will send the characters you have already typed, and also the ones that you type after hitting the key, until you press <Enter>. After pressing <Enter>, the normal exchange will be sent. You may set the START SENDING NOW KEY to the <Space> key with the command: START SENDING NOW KEY = SPACE If the cursor is in the Call Window, then the space bar only causes sending to begin if there is at least one character in the window.

[STATIONS CALLSIGNS MASK]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=

[STEREO CONTROL PIN]
DEFAULT=9
DESCRIPTION=Values: 5 or 9. This command sets the number of the pin to be used for controlling stereo on the STEREO CONTROL PORT. If you use pin 5, then you cannot use the same port for controlling a DVK; if you use pin 9 then you cannot use the same port for band output.

[STEREO CONTROL PORT]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=

[STEREO PIN HIGH]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This command sets the state of the STEREO CONTROL PIN on the STEREO CONTROL PORT. The value may be toggled with the function key command TOGGLESTEREOPIN.

[SWAP PACKET SPOT RADIOS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, TR4W reverses which rig receives a packet spot when ctrl-U and the left/right cursor keys are used. This is useful if your station is configured such that your rig number 2 is physically on the left.

[SWAP PADDLES]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter swaps the dit and dah inputs on the paddle port. This is handy if your paddle is wired backwards.

[SWAP RADIO RELAY SENSE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When this parameter is TRUE, TR4W reverses the polarity of the relay for controlling the radio.

[TAIL END KEY]
DEFAULT=]
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any key. The TAIL END KEY allows you to respond to tail enders when finishing a CQ mode QSO.

[TELNET SERVER]
DEFAULT=sk3w.se:8000
DESCRIPTION=Address of default telnet cluster.

[TEN MINUTE RULE]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Values: NONE or TIME OF FIRST QSO. This parameter selects the mode for the ten minute rule. The TIME OF FIRST QSO mode will cause the elapsed time since your first QSO on the active band to be displayed.

[TUNE ALT-D ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If this parameter is TRUE, then the following behaviour occurs: if you are in CQ Mode on the active radio, then as you tune the inactive radio, calls from the bandmap (if not dupes) are automatically entered so that they can be worked with the alt-D command. This saves you from having to enter the calls manually.

[TUNE WITH DITS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If this parameter is TRUE, TR4W sends a string of dits at 75 WPM when ctrl-Left-Shift is pressed

[TWO RADIO MODE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Values: TRUE or FALSE .When this parameter is TRUE, TR4W is in two radio mode. See section

[UDP BROADCAST APP INFO]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If true, TR4W sends an XML broadcast with the application information to any programs listening. Note this is compatible with the N1MM format UDP broadcast so programs such as qsorder, ClubPi and N1MM to DXKeeper Gateway can use this function.

[UDP BROADCAST CONTACT INFO]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If true, TR4W sends an XML broadcast of relevent contacting information to any programs listening. Note this is compatible with the N1MM format UDP broadcast so programs such as qsorder, ClubPi and N1MM to DXKeeper Gateway can use this function.

[UDP BROADCAST RADIO INFO]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If true, TR4W sends an XML broadcast whenever the radio changes frequency. This is compatible with the N1MM broadcast so programs such as 2Tone as well as hardware that listens for this data (such as Palstar's HF-Auto) will function.

[UDP BROADCAST ROTOR]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If true, TR4W sends an XML broadcast of a request to turn a rotor controlled by an external rotor control program such as N1MM Rotator Control or PstRotator. Note this is broadcast on the Rotor Port (default=12040)

[UDP BROADCAST PORT]
DEFAULT=12060
DESCRIPTION=*** DEPRECATED *** The UDP broadcast port to which all data is sent (except the rotor information). Do not use this one any more. Use the individual ports below.

[UDP BROADCAST PORT APP INFO]
DEFAULT=12060
DESCRIPTION=The UDP broadcast port to which the APPINFO packet is sent.

[UDP BROADCAST PORT CONTACT]
DEFAULT=12060
DESCRIPTION=The UDP broadcast port to which all CONTACT data is sent.

[UDP BROADCAST PORT RADIO]
DEFAULT=12060
DESCRIPTION=The UDP broadcast port to which all RADIO data is sent.

[UDP BROADCAST PORT SCORE]
DEFAULT=12060
DESCRIPTION=The UDP broadcast port to which all SCORE data is sent.

[UDP BROADCAST ROTOR PORT]
DEFAULT=12040
DESCRIPTION=The UDP broadcast port to which rotor control messages are sent.

[UDP BROADCAST ADDRESS]
DEFAULT=127.0.0.1
DESCRIPTION=The IPv4 address to which UDP messages are sent. Note that using 127.0.0.1 sends the message to the local computer. If a device is listening on a different system, then the IP address with 255 in the last octet should be used. For example, if the log computer has IP address 192.168.1.10, then 192.168.1.255 would broadcast to any listening devices on the entire subnet.

[UDP BROADCAST ALL QSOS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If true, contacts received from the network are also broadcast via UDP. This allows a single computer to feed all QSOs to the network. Please note that if this option is TRUE, then the other computers on the network should not also have this option OR UDP BROADCAST CONTACT INFO set lest a broadcast storm is created.
[UNKNOWN COUNTRY FILE ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter controls the generation of the unknown country file. This file will list all the QSOs with callsigns for which TR4W cannot determine the country. This is a good way to find calls that might be new multipliers for you. By default, the file is named UNKNOWN.CTY, but you can change the name of the file with the UNKNOWN COUNTRY FILE NAME command. You can also find unknown countries after the contest using the Multiplier Check procedure in POST.

[UNKNOWN COUNTRY FILE NAME]
DEFAULT=UNKNOWN.CTY
DESCRIPTION=Values: Any valid filename. TR4W will save log entries for QSOs with unknown countries to the named file if UNKNOWN COUNTRY FILE ENABLE is TRUE.

[USE CONTROL PORT]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=

[USE RECORDED SIGNS]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=

[USER INFO SHOWN]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=The values correspond to fields in the TRMASTER database. Any one of these can be viewed in a window just below the Call Window for the station you are working. If you choose CUSTOM, your initial exchange will be built using the CUSTOM USER STRING. This allows you to choose multiple data fields and display them in any order.

[VHF BAND ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=When set to TRUE, TR4W will allow the selection of the VHF and UHF bands using the alt-B and alt-V keys.

[WAIT FOR STRENGTH]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When you use the [ character in a CW message, TR4W will allow you to enter the strength of an RST report by pressing a single numeric key. If WAIT FOR STRENGTH is TRUE, the program will wait for you to enter the strength before continuing the CW message. If WAIT FOR STRENGTH is FALSE and you havent pressed a key by the time the program is ready to send the strength, it will act as if you had pressed the 9 key and proceed with the message.

[WAKE UP TIME OUT]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=TR4W can keep track of how many minutes have passed since your last QSO. If this number reaches a programmable limit, an alarm will sound once a minute until you work somebody. This is useful for long contests where you operate until brain death and need 20 or 30 minutes to become functional again. Since this is a dangerous time to try to set an alarm, the program will automatically start counting the minutes. The wake up time out alarm is disabled if the alarm has been set.

[WARC BAND ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=This command allows you to operate on 30, 17 and 12 metres. The default is FALSE, unless you are in General QSO mode.

[WEIGHT]
DEFAULT=1.00
DESCRIPTION=Values: 0.5 to 1.5. This command controls the weight of the CW generated by the computer. For example, a value of 1.05 will add 5 percent to the duration of each dot and dash.

[WILDCARD PARTIALS]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=This command controls the working of the partial call function. When this parameter is FALSE, only calls that start with the input call will be shown. When set to TRUE (the default), the input call can appear anywhere within the partial call. This allows you to perform a partial call check with the prefix or the suffix, instead of only with the prefix. If your partial call function is working too slowly, you might try setting this flag to FALSE. This flag only affects the partial call display from the dupesheet. The super check partial display always will use wildcard partials.

[WK AUTOSPACE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=If you pause for more than one dit time between a dit or dah Winkeyer2 will interpret this as a letter-space and will not send the next dit or dah until full letter-space time has been met.

[WK CT SPACING]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Winkeyer2 supports contest spacing which reduces the wordspace time by one dit. Instead of 7 dits per wordspace, WK CT SPACING=TRUE selects six dits per wordspace.

[WK DIT DAH RATIO]
DEFAULT=50
DESCRIPTION=Modifies the ratio of dit time to dah time, the standard being 1:3 (dit:dah). The formula to determine dah/dit ratio is: DAH/DIT = 3*(nn/50). A value of 50 selects 1:3, a value of 33 would select 1:2, and a value of 66 would select 1:4.

[WK ENABLE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Use Winkeyer instead of internal program keyer.

[WK FIRST EXTENSION]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Value: integer in the range of (0 to 250) * 1 mSecs. Winkeyer2 addresses a problem often encountered when keying older transceivers that have a slow breakin response. Due to a slow receive to transmit changeover time, the first dit or dah of a letter sequence can be chopped and reduced in length. Adding a fixed amount to the first element of a sequence can compensate for this.

[WK IGNORE SPEED POT]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=If TRUE then TR4W will ignore change of Winkeyer speed spot position.

[WK KEYER COMPENSATION]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Value: integer in the range of (0 to 250) * 1 mSecs. Keying Compensation allows a fixed amount to be added to the length of all dits and dahs. QSK keying on modern transceivers can cause shortening of the dit and dah elements which is especially noticeable at high speeds. Winkeyer2 allows the length of the dit and dah elements to be increased uniformly to compensate for this. The adjustments are made in units of one-millisecond steps. The maximum adjustment is 250 mSecs. Key compensation is very similar to Weighting in that any adjustment added to the dits and dahs is subtracted from the spacing so the speed is not changed. The difference between weighting and compensation is that compensation is independent of speed, so if 10 msec of key compensation is selected 10 msec will be always be added regardless of speed.

[WK KEYER MODE]
DEFAULT=IAMBIC B
DESCRIPTION=In iambic mode Winkeyer2 makes both dits and dahs automatically based on which paddle you press. In bug mode Winkeyer2 makes the dits and you make the dahs. You also can use bug mode to operate in straight key mode or if you want to key through Winkeyer2 with a different keyer, simply set bug mode and use the dah input to key Winkeyer2. In either iambic mode, alternating dits and dahs are sent while both paddles are held closed. In mode B an extra alternate dit or dah is sent after both paddles are released. In Ultimatic mode when both paddles are pressed the keyer will send a continuous stream of whichever paddle was last pressed.

[WK LEADIN TIME]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Value: integer in the range of (0 to 250) * 10 mSecs. Time delay between when PTT is asserted and when CW keying will start.

[WK PADDLE ONLY SIDETONE]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=In WK2 you can choose to only use sidetone for paddle entry and mute it for CW sourced from the host port.

[WK PADDLE SWAP]
DEFAULT=FALSE
DESCRIPTION=Feature for right or left handed ops.

[WK PADDLE SWITCHPOINT]
DEFAULT=50
DESCRIPTION=Value: integer in the range of 10 - 90%. This controls when Winkeyer2 will start looking for a new paddle press after sensing the current one. If there is not enough delay the keyer will send unwanted dits or dahs, if there is too much delay it bogs you down because you can't get ahead of the keyer. The default value is one dit time (50) and is adjustable in percent of a dit time. The delay is calculated with this formula: DELAY_TIME = (SWITCHPOINT*DIT_TIME)/50 where SWITCHPOINT is a value between 10 and 90.

[WK PORT]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=Serial port to which Winkeyer is connected.

[WK SIDETONE FREQUENCY]
DEFAULT=800
DESCRIPTION=Define one of the WK2 sidetone frequency. These frequencies are slightly different than WK1.

[WK SIDETONE ENABLE]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=Specifies whether Winkeyer sidetone is enabled.

[WK TAIL TIME]
DEFAULT=0
DESCRIPTION=Value: integer in the range of (0 to 250) * 10 mSecs. Define how long the transmitter will stay in transmit after keying has stopped.

[WK WEIGHT]
DEFAULT=50
DESCRIPTION=Value: integer in the range of 10 - 90%. This command allows a proportional amount to be either added or subtracted from the length of all dits and dahs sent. A value of 50 selects no weighting adjustment. Values less than 50 reduce weighting and values greater than 50 increase weighting. Note that weighting does not affect sending speed because any increase in keyed time is subtracted from spacing time. Reduction in weighting results in a thinner sounding keying while increased weighting results in a heavier sound. Since weighting tracks speed, a given weighting will sound the same at all speeds.

[WINDOW SIZE]
DEFAULT=5
DESCRIPTION=The relative ratio of 1 to 15, which determines the size of the main program window.

[WSJT-X BROADCAST PORT]
DEFAULT=2237
DESCRIPTION=When running with an integrated WSJT-X instance, this is the UDP port on which TR4W listens for broadcasts from WSJT-X. If you change this from the default, you have to ensure the corresponding entry is changed on the WSJT-X Settings...Reporting tab under UDP Server. This will also work to accept broadcasts for the JT-Alert Last QSO API (but not at the same time as WSJT-X to avoid duplicate log entries).
[WSJT-X ENABLED]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When true, TR4W will offer the UDP server on the WSJT-X Broadcast Port. This option allows one to set this to false so TR4W does not interfere with JT-Alert or other listeners on the broadcast port. It also saves TR4W from processing commands if there is no need for it to do so.
[WSJT-X SEND HIGHLIGHTS]
DEFAULT=TRUE
DESCRIPTION=When TRUE, as CQ messages are decoded in WSJT-X, the call is highlighted in the QSOB4 or MULT colors based on the callsign's status in the TR4W log. This can be set to FALSE if a user would prefer to use the native WSJT-X colors such as when using the GENERAL LOG.
 
[ZONE MULTIPLIER]
DEFAULT=NONE
DESCRIPTION=This parameter tells TR4W how to handle the zone multipliers. It is normally set up by the CONTEST statement in your *.CFG file.
